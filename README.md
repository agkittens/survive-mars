# survive-mars
Survive Mars is a game inspired by "Surviving Mars." This application simulates a Martian colony, where the player is responsible for managing the quality of life within the colony. The game features four locations: the City, Gardens, Transport Hub, and Reactor. Each location offers interactive mechanics that help the player maintain a high state of the colony. However, some actions may have adverse effects on other resources.

## Locations and Features
### City
In the City, you have access to:

- Report Window: View detailed reports about the colony.
- Resource Overviews: Monitor the status of four essential resources (water, food, oxygen, power) along with options to increase their values.
- Player Presence Check: A button that checks for the player's presence every 30 seconds.
